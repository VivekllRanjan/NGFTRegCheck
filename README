How It Works:
A list of IP phones (by device name, e.g., SEP00AABBCCDDEE) is stored in a simple CSV file.
Every 5 minutes, a shell script triggers a Python script that:
SSHs into the CUCM CLI
Runs show risdb query phone name <device> for each device
Logs the output (registration status and basic info) to a timestamped log file
Results are archived for auditing or reporting purposes.
 
Benefits:
Proactive Monitoring: Helps detect unregistered phones quickly.
Time Saver: No need to manually log into CUCM GUI and search phone-by-phone.
Scalable: Can be expanded to hundreds of phones or integrated with SNOW/Splunk/Wx Bot.
Non-intrusive: Read-only CLI (CMS-NOC-RO) access ensures system integrity.
 
If needed we can easily port the tool to Ansible and Splunk for wider use cases.
